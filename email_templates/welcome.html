		<h1>Hello and welcome to your online work schedule!</h1>
		
		<p>
			Before you get started, I did want to provide you with some 
			technical details of how this all works to ensure you are 
			comfortable with the program. Should there be anything you do not 
			agree with in the information below, please send an email to the
			owner of this program requesting that you are removed from the 
			program. If no email is received, you will receive automatic 
			calendar updates and emails from this program.
		</p>

		<h2>Security</h2>

		<p>
			To make your schedule accessible to all your devices and programs, 
			the calendar must be: 1) publically available; and 2) hosted on 
			my own personal server.

			<ol>
				<li>
					This means that anyone with your schedule link could view 
					your calendar. To minimize the risk of this, the calendar 
					file does not actually use your name, but rather a code 
					name. These names are generally a long enough/complex 
					enough that it makes someone guessing your calendar very 
					unlikely.
				</li>
				<li>
					While my own servers are also secured, I would suspect the 
					safety of the AHS Network would still be superior. To my 
					knowledge all major steps have been taken to secure the 
					server, but this can change rapidly and it can take time 
					to implement fixes.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
		
		<p>
			This program relies on a number of assumptions to properly 
			generate a correct work schedule. There are numerous factors that 
			can cause issues with the generation of these schedules, such as 
			new shift codes, typos in the Microsoft Excel document, or 
			duplicate names on the spreadsheet. While I do try to account for 
			many of these, it will never be perfect. To reduce these risks, 
			you will be emailed whenever your updated schedule varies from the 
			previous version of the schedule. You will also receive a list of 
			all the assumptions the program made. You are strongly encouraged 
			to review these emails for any possible errors.
		</p>

		<p>
			There is also the risk that there will be an issue with my own 
			servers that may cause delays in schedule updates. While I do try 
			to limit these occurrences, there is always the possibility of 
			unexpected issues that can take several days (or longer) to 
			resolve.
		</p>

		<p>
			Finally, this whole project is done on my own spare time with my 
			own resources. I am happy to provide some degree of assistance in 
			using these programs (largely in the forms of tutorials or how-to 
			documents), but from a practical standpoint I cannot provide 
			individual and personalized tech support. I also cannot dedicate 
			large portions of the work day to this, as it does not fall within 
			the scope of my AHS employment. 
		</p>

        <h2>Customizability</h2>
        
        <p>
            You will have the option of customizing various aspects of your
            calendar, including:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Choosing your anonymous calendar name
                </li>
                <li>
                    Having the calendar generate shifts as "Full Day" events 
                    or as specific events with start and stop times
                </li>
                <li>
                    Customize start and stop times for specific shifts
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set a reminder of upcoming shifts ranging from 0 to 60
                    minutes in advance
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
